# **Gutenberg Book Fetcher**

### **Project Overview**
The **Gutenberg Book Fetcher** is a web application that allows users to search for books from the Project Gutenberg API, view a list of books, and see detailed information about selected books. This project dynamically fetches book data from the [Gutenberg API](https://gutendex.com/), displays the results, and allows users to view detailed information about each book on a separate page.

---

### **Features**
- Fetches book data dynamically from the Gutenberg API.
- Allows users to search for specific books.
- Displays book details such as title, author, subjects, translators, languages, and download count.
- Opens detailed information about a book in a new page.
- Responsive UI with clean design and dynamic content updates using JavaScript.
- Page dynamically styled with CSS for consistent appearance of both static and dynamically generated content.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: Markup structure for the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the web pages, including both static and dynamic content.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Dynamic content fetching, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
- **Gutenberg API**: Provides book data from the Project Gutenberg library.

### **Setup Instructions**

#### **Prerequisites**

### **Usage**

1. **Search for Books:**
   - On the main page (`index.html`), enter a keyword in the search bar to find books related to the keyword.
   - Click on the "Search" button to initiate the search.

2. **View Book Details:**
   - After the search, a list of books will be displayed.
   - Click on any book title to view its detailed information in a new tab.

3. **Book Details Page:**
   - On the detailed page (`book.html`), information such as the title, author, subjects, languages, and download count of the book will be displayed.
   - You can also view the available formats and download or read the book online.

---

### **JavaScript Explanation**
- **`script.js`**: Handles the main functionality of fetching the list of books based on the search query and displaying them on the main page. When a book is clicked, it passes the book's ID to the `book.html` page using query parameters.
  
- **`book.js`**: Retrieves the book's ID from the URL query parameters and uses it to fetch detailed information about the selected book. This information is then dynamically displayed on the page.

---

### **CSS Explanation**
- The `style.css` and `book.css` files contain styling for the static contents of the web pages and the dynamically inserted elements, ensuring that all content maintains a consistent design and layout.
  
- The **`book-info`** section on `book.html` is dynamically generated by JavaScript and styled using the classes defined in `book.css`.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add pagination to display more books from the search results.
- Implement a loading spinner while fetching the book data.
- Improve the search functionality by allowing for advanced filters (e.g., filtering by author or language).
- Implement local storage to save users' favorite books.
